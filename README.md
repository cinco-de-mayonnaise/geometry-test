# Geometry Test
Playing around with some examples, eventually plan to make some full fleged visual arts demonstrations similar to demo scene cracktros. :P
Every major milestone will be marked as VXX, which should be fully usable/complete and compile without errors.

### Compile

Ensure SDL2 and SDL2_ttf are installed, then
`g++ main.cpp -o main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf && ./main`

For raylib, it's much easier (to install)
`g++ main.cpp -o main -lraylib`

I actually started out with really wanting to learn SDL3, but SDL3 is a pain in the butt to use on Linux for now... I'll have to wait for it to be available on apt repositories...
But then I discovered raylib and realized it's way easier/cooler than SDL, so I'll be using this mu hahaha haha... ha.
